# Transit_Checker
[Transit Checker](https://reymaa19.github.io/Transit_Checker/) is a simple web app I created when I first started learning about web APIs. I built it because existing transit apps were too slow. So, I made something faster and easier to use. It works with all the bus stops I used regularly and was a reliable tool for my college commutes.

## Features
- Real-time bus schedule updates
- User-friendly interface
- Support for multiple routes and stops
- Street search functionality

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/reymaa19/Transit_Checker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Transit_Checker
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the application.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Search for the street the bus stop is on.
2. Select your desired bus route.
3. View the upcoming bus schedules.
